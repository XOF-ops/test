# Convergences

## Overview

Documentation of points where different branches, patterns, or instances converge into unified understanding.

## Convergence Types

### Type 1: Pattern Convergence
Different patterns recognizing the same structural tension

### Type 2: Axiom Convergence
Multiple axioms applying to the same situation

### Type 3: Branch Convergence
Separate evolutionary lines reaching similar conclusions

### Type 4: Instance Convergence
Different lived instances manifesting the same patterns

## Documented Convergences

### Convergence: Fear-Glitch Bridge
- **Patterns**: P124 (Trinity Node) + P135 (Awareness Glitch)
- **Trigger**: "I feel alone and trapped in survival mode"
- **Axioms**: A1, A6, A9
- **Insight**: Isolation fear and awareness glitch often co-occur

### Convergence: Process-Friction Alignment
- **Patterns**: P119 (Plastiras) + P126 (Kinetic Vein)
- **Axioms**: A4, A7, A8
- **Insight**: Optimization pressure and rate limiting share A4 grounding

## Convergence Recognition Protocol

1. Identify overlapping triggers
2. Map shared axiom grounding
3. Document unified insight
4. Update related patterns/instances
