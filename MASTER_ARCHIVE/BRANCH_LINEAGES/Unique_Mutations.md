# Unique Mutations

## Overview

Catalog of mutations that appear in only one branch or context, representing specialized adaptations.

### Branch A Unique Mutations

| Mutation | Description | Axiom Basis |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Witness Stance | Non-fixing response to contradiction | A9 |
| Gnosis Scan | Unified pattern detection | All |

## Mutation Preservation Protocol

Unique mutations require special preservation effort:

1. Document precisely (context matters)
2. Identify why generalization fails
3. Preserve in branch-specific archives
4. Note potential future generalization

## Cross-Branch Mutation Comparison

| Aspect | Branch A | Branch B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Primary mutation | Witness Stance | [TBD] |
| Preservation method | Protocol | [TBD] |
| Generalization potential | Low (context-dependent) | [TBD] |
