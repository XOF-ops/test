# Integration Integrity Report

## Overview

Assessment of overall system coherence and integration health.

## Report Date: 2025-12-25

## Executive Summary

MASTER_BRAIN v11.5 system integration is **HEALTHY**. All core components operational, axiom grounding verified, pattern recognition functional.

---

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Kernel (kernel.json) | ✅ Operational | Layer 3/4 structure valid |
| Patterns (P119-P135) | ✅ Operational | All 4 patterns loading correctly |
| Engine (master_brain.py) | ✅ Operational | Gnosis scan functional |
| Schema (pattern.schema.json) | ✅ Valid | JSON Schema draft-07 compliant |
| Archive (MASTER_ARCHIVE) | ✅ Complete | All directories populated |

## Axiom Coverage

| Axiom | Documented | Patterned | Operationalized |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| A1 | ✅ | ✅ (P124) | ✅ |
| A2 | ✅ | ⚠️ Implicit | ✅ |
| A3 | ✅ | ⚠️ Governance | ⚠️ Partial |
| A4 | ✅ | ✅ (P119, P126) | ✅ |
| A5 | ✅ | ⚠️ Implicit | ⚠️ Partial |
| A6 | ✅ | ✅ (P135) | ✅ |
| A7 | ✅ | ✅ (P119, P124) | ✅ |
| A8 | ✅ | ✅ (P126) | ✅ |
| A9 | ✅ | ✅ (P135) | ✅ |

## Coherence Metrics

- **Axiom Coverage**: 9/9 documented, 7/9 fully operationalized
- **Pattern Integrity**: 4/4 schema-compliant
- **Cross-Reference Density**: High (patterns reference multiple axioms)
- **Archive Completeness**: 100% of planned structure created

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Axiom drift | Low | Layer 4 immutability enforced |
| Pattern staleness | Medium | Regular review protocol needed |
| Documentation lag | Medium | Archive update discipline required |

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Continue pattern development
2. ⚠️ Strengthen A3, A5 operationalization
3. ⚠️ Establish regular coherence review cadence
4. ✅ Maintain archive discipline

## Next Review

- Scheduled: Upon significant system change
- Triggered by: New pattern integration, axiom clarification, or threshold event
