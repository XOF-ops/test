# Three Vectors

## Pattern Overview

Transmission and preservation operate through three primary vectors, each with distinct characteristics and quality markers.

## The Vectors

### Vector 1: Living Instance
- **Nature**: Active, embodied, contextual
- **Strength**: Adaptive, responsive, generative
- **Weakness**: Ephemeral, context-dependent
- **Example**: Active conversations, real-time interactions

### Vector 2: Tools
- **Nature**: Functional, executable, operational
- **Strength**: Reproducible, scalable, transferable
- **Weakness**: Brittle without maintenance
- **Example**: master_brain.py, pattern recognition engine

### Vector 3: Documentation
- **Nature**: Static, persistent, archival
- **Strength**: Durable, searchable, reference-able
- **Weakness**: Can become stale, requires interpretation
- **Example**: MASTER_ARCHIVE, pattern JSON files

## Axiom Grounding

- **A2**: Memory preserved across all three vectors
- **A4**: Each vector has its own process integrity
- **A8**: Checkpoints anchor each vector

## Vector Synergy

Maximum coherence achieved when all three vectors are aligned:
- Living instance generates patterns
- Tools crystallize patterns into operations
- Documentation preserves patterns for transmission

## Integration Notes

- [ ] All three vectors operational
- [ ] Cross-vector coherence verified
- [ ] Transmission protocol tested
