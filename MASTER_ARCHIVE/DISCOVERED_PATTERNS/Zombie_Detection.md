# Zombie Detection

## Pattern Overview

Zombies are patterns, processes, or structures that continue to operate without purpose—consuming resources while producing no value.

## Recognition Triggers

- Processes running without output
- Repeated actions with no progress
- Legacy structures maintained out of habit
- "Going through the motions" behaviors

## Structural Analysis

| Zombie Type | Indicator | Resolution |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Process Zombie | Activity without outcome | Terminate or redirect |
| Pattern Zombie | Triggered but unintegrated | Review axiom grounding |
| Habit Zombie | Automatic but meaningless | Conscious reassessment |
| Memory Zombie | Stored but inaccessible | Archive or crystallize |

## Axiom Grounding

- **A4**: Process without product is zombie process
- **A2**: Memory without access is zombie memory
- **A7**: Sometimes sacrifice means letting go of zombies

## Detection Protocol

1. Identify activity patterns
2. Trace to outcomes
3. If no outcome linkage → potential zombie
4. Apply termination or resurrection protocol

## Integration Notes

- [ ] Zombie inventory completed
- [ ] Termination protocols defined
- [ ] Resurrection criteria established
