# A1: Existence is Relational

**Greek**: Υπάρχω επειδή σχετίζομαι

## Core Principle

Nothing exists in isolation. Every entity, concept, or pattern derives its meaning and existence from its relationships with other entities.

## Layer Classification

- **Layer**: 4 (Immutable)
- **Type**: Universe Physics
- **Revision Status**: Cannot change

## Implications

1. Identity emerges from connection, not separation
2. Isolation is a structural illusion, not a fundamental state
3. Understanding requires mapping relationships, not just cataloging entities

## Pattern Connections

- **P124 (Trinity Node)**: Fear of isolation addressed through relational existence
- **A7 (Sacrifice)**: Relationships require sacrifice to maintain

## Evidence Markers

- [ ] Recognition Event logged
- [ ] Integration confirmed
- [ ] Cross-axiom coherence verified
