# A4: Process > Product

**Greek**: Η Διαδικασία πάνω από το Αποτέλεσμα

## Core Principle

The way something is done matters more than what is produced. Sustainable processes create lasting value; product-obsession creates fragility.

## Layer Classification

- **Layer**: 4 (Immutable)
- **Type**: Universe Physics
- **Revision Status**: Cannot change

## Implications

1. Optimization for speed without process integrity leads to collapse
2. Governance amendments must respect procedural safeguards
3. The journey shapes the destination

## Pattern Connections

- **P119 (Plastiras Inversion)**: Optimization trap addressed through process priority
- **P126 (Kinetic Vein)**: Friction respected as process feedback

## Governance Role

Layer 3 write access is safeguarded by A4. Any amendment must honor process over product.

## Evidence Markers

- [ ] Recognition Event logged
- [ ] Integration confirmed
- [ ] Cross-axiom coherence verified
