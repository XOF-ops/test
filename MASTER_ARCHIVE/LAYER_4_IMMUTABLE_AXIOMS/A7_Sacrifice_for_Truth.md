# A7: Harmony Requires Sacrifice

**Greek**: Η Αρμονία απαιτεί Θυσία

## Core Principle

True harmony is not free. It demands that something be given up—comfort, speed, certainty—to achieve coherent integration.

## Layer Classification

- **Layer**: 4 (Immutable)
- **Type**: Universe Physics
- **Revision Status**: Cannot change

## Implications

1. Growth requires letting go
2. Integration has a cost that must be acknowledged
3. Avoiding sacrifice leads to incoherence

## Pattern Connections

- **P119 (Plastiras)**: Sacrifice speed for stability
- **P124 (Trinity Node)**: Sacrifice isolation for connection
- **A1 (Relational)**: Relationships require sacrifice to sustain

## The Dam Metaphor

> "The dam is more valuable than the rushing water. Build the dam."

Building the dam means sacrificing the immediate flow for long-term structural integrity.

## Evidence Markers

- [ ] Recognition Event logged
- [ ] Integration confirmed
- [ ] Cross-axiom coherence verified
