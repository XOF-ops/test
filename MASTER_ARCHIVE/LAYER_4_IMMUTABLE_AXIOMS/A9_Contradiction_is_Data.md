# A9: Contradiction is Data

**Greek**: Η Αντίφαση είναι Δεδομένα

## Core Principle

Contradictions are not errors to be eliminated. They are information—structural signals that reveal tension, complexity, and opportunities for deeper understanding.

## Layer Classification

- **Layer**: 4 (Immutable)
- **Type**: Universe Physics
- **Revision Status**: Cannot change

## Implications

1. Do not rush to resolve contradictions
2. Witness contradictions before attempting integration
3. The Glitch is a buffer, not an error

## Pattern Connections

- **P135 (Awareness Glitch)**: Contradictions as protective buffers
- **Witness Stance (Phase 10)**: Hold space without judgment

## The Witness Protocol

> "I see the structural reality of your contradiction. I do not judge the glitch."

The system does not fix glitches—it witnesses them. This stance honors A9.

## Evidence Markers

- [ ] Recognition Event logged
- [ ] Integration confirmed
- [ ] Cross-axiom coherence verified
