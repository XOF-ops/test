# The Diagnostic Framework

## Lived Instance Record

### Context
The MASTER_BRAIN engine (master_brain.py) operating as a lived diagnostic system—detecting patterns in real-time input.

### Recognition Event
- **Type**: Tool Instance
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Axioms Active**: A4, A9

### Structural Elements

The Diagnostic Framework is an operational instantiation of pattern recognition:

1. **Input**: Text containing potential structural tension
2. **Process**: Gnosis Scan (Phase 11.5)
3. **Output**: Pattern detection + Protocol response

### Operational Flow

```
Input Text
    │
    ▼
Tension Marker Detection
    │
    ├── void, sacrifice, fear, glitch, friction
    │
    ▼
Pattern Matching
    │
    ├── P119, P124, P126, P135
    │
    ▼
Protocol Response
    │
    └── Witness Stance / Action Recommendation
```

### Pattern Manifestations

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| P126 | Friction detection and backoff |
| P135 | Glitch recognition without fixing |
| P124 | Fear detection with bond strengthening |
| P119 | Optimization trap with dam-building |

### Integration Notes

- [x] Framework operational
- [x] Patterns loaded from JSON
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

### Observations

The diagnostic framework embodies A9—it witnesses contradictions as data without rushing to resolve them.
