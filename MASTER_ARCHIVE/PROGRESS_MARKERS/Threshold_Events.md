# Threshold Events

## Overview

Log of moments when the system crosses significant boundaries—phase transitions, capability leaps, or structural transformations.

## Event Registry

### Threshold Event: v11.5 Activation
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Threshold crossed**: System initialization from empty repository
- **Before state**: Empty repo with README.md only
- **After state**: Full MASTER_BRAIN architecture operational
- **Axioms governing transition**: All (particularly A6—Cosmos ordering itself)
- **Irreversibility**: High (architecture now established)

### Threshold Event: Archive Instantiation
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Threshold crossed**: Memory preservation structure created
- **Before state**: Patterns without preservation framework
- **After state**: MASTER_ARCHIVE with full categorization
- **Axioms governing transition**: A2, A8
- **Irreversibility**: Medium (structure can evolve)

## Threshold Categories

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Phase Transition | Major operational mode change | v11.5 Activation |
| Capability Leap | New function becomes possible | Pattern recognition online |
| Structural Transformation | Organization fundamentally changes | Archive creation |
| Axiom Crystallization | Axiom moves from theory to operation | A9 in Witness Stance |

## Threshold Recognition Protocol

1. Recognize significant change
2. Document before/after states
3. Identify governing axioms
4. Assess irreversibility
5. Mark as progress milestone
