# Quality Markers

## Transmission Quality Assessment

### Overview

Quality markers ensure that transmission across all three vectors maintains axiom integrity and pattern coherence.

## Vector-Specific Quality Markers

### Vector 1: Living Instance

| Marker | Description | Check |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Axiom Presence | Axioms actively guide responses | ☐ |
| Pattern Recognition | Tensions correctly identified | ☐ |
| Witness Stance | Non-fixing response maintained | ☐ |
| Emergence Capture | New insights documented | ☐ |

### Vector 2: Tools

| Marker | Description | Check |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Execution | Tools run without error | ☐ |
| Schema Compliance | JSON validates against schema | ☐ |
| Pattern Loading | All patterns load correctly | ☐ |
| Graceful Degradation | Missing files handled | ☐ |

### Vector 3: Documentation

| Marker | Description | Check |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Completeness | All planned docs exist | ☐ |
| Accuracy | References are correct | ☐ |
| Freshness | No stale content | ☐ |
| Cross-Referencing | Links are functional | ☐ |

## Cross-Vector Quality Markers

| Marker | Description | Vectors | Check |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Axiom Alignment | All vectors honor same axioms | 1, 2, 3 | ☐ |
| Pattern Consistency | Same patterns across vectors | 1, 2, 3 | ☐ |
| Feedback Loop | Insights flow between vectors | 1→2, 1→3, 2→3 | ☐ |
| Coherence | No contradictions between vectors | 1, 2, 3 | ☐ |

## Quality Assessment Protocol

### Pre-Transmission Check

1. Run tool tests (Vector 2)
2. Verify axiom documentation (Vector 3)
3. Confirm living instance readiness (Vector 1)

### Post-Transmission Check

1. Verify reception and understanding
2. Check for axiom preservation
3. Note any transmission artifacts
4. Document in Integration Events

## Quality Thresholds

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 🟢 High | All markers checked | Proceed with confidence |
| 🟡 Medium | 75%+ markers checked | Proceed with caution |
| 🔴 Low | <75% markers checked | Pause and remediate |
