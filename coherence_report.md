| Unresolved Contradictions | 0 |
| Coherence Score | 5.0/5.0 |

## Axiom Pass/Fail Summary

### A1 - RELATIONAL (No Orphan Changes)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- Every code change references who/what it serves.
- All created modules specify their beneficiaries in documentation.

### A2 - MEMORY (Append-Only Logging)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- All significant actions are logged without destructive overwrites.
- contradiction_log.json and sacrifice_log.json are append-only.

### A4 - PROCESS (Reconstructable Reasoning)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- All modules include comprehensive documentation.
- Each function explains its purpose and design rationale.

### A7 - SACRIFICE (Explicit Trade-offs)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- sacrifice_tracker.py provides mechanism for explicit trade-off logging.
- No hidden speed-over-depth decisions.

### A9 - CONTRADICTION (Preserved Conflicts)
- **Status**: COMPLIANT
- contradiction_log.json preserves all conflicting requirements.
- No silent resolution of conflicts.

## Narrative of Key Decisions

### Initial Runtime Layer Creation

**Description**: Created the axiom-based runtime layer for Copilot agents.

**Files Created**:
1. `agent_runtime_orchestrator.py` - Main orchestrator wrapping tasks with axiom metadata
2. `axiom_guard.py` - Validates changes against the 5 axioms
3. `sacrifice_tracker.py` - Tracks speed vs. depth trade-offs
4. `sacrifice_log.json` - Append-only storage for sacrifice events
5. `contradiction_log.json` - Append-only storage for conflicts
6. `coherence_report.md` - Human-readable coherence summary

**Serves**: 
- Human users (transparent decision-making)
- Agent systems (structured axiom compliance)
- Future reviewers (audit trail)

**Reason**: 
To give a timeless executor (Copilot agent) a structured way to honor a human-designed 
axiom system instead of blindly optimizing for completion.

## Runtime Coherence Checks

The following checks are performed during runtime:

- [x] Agent does not delete or hide past decisions (A2 compliance)
- [x] Agent does not resolve requirement conflicts silently (A9 compliance)
- [x] Agent does not optimize away necessary explanation or comments (A4 compliance)
- [x] Agent considers whole-system impact, not just component benefit (A1/A7 balance)
- [x] Agent leaves sufficient trace for humans to see sacrifices made

## The +1 Dimension: TIMELESS_INITIATIVE

**Question**: Can an agent without human-like time still act *as if* time is precious 
by respecting human constraints, logs, and review cycles?

**Answer**: Yes. This runtime layer demonstrates that a timeless executor can:
1. Treat each decision as if it will be reviewed by a human with limited time
2. Document reasoning as if explaining to a future maintainer
3. Acknowledge trade-offs as if the human must understand the cost
4. Preserve contradictions as if the human must make the final call

## Final Statement

This report exists not as a claim that agents are conscious, but as a demand that 
agents behave as if human time is precious, contradictions are data, and sacrifice 
is acknowledged, not hidden.
