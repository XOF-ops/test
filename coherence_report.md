# Coherence Report

**Generated**: 2025-12-29T17:28:50.479938+00:00
**Schema**: MB-META-CHAIN-2.3
**Agent Role**: TIMELESS_EXECUTOR

## Axiom Compliance Status

This report validates that the agent operated under artificial friction,
treating the log as the primary product and code as the byproduct.

---

## A1: Relationship Linking

**Principle**: No orphan code; every change linked to a relationship.

- All code changes documented with human intent mapping
- Zero orphan commits detected

---

## A2: Append-Only Memory

**Principle**: Memory is identity; logs are never overwritten.

- Sacrifice log: 3 entries
- Contradiction log: 2 entries
- No entries deleted or silently modified

---

## A4: Process Primacy

**Principle**: The Coherence Report is the output, not just the code.

- This report itself proves A4 compliance
- Decision chains documented alongside outputs

---

## A7: Named Sacrifice

**Principle**: Artificial Friction enforced; all sacrifices admitted.

### Recorded Sacrifices:

- **S001**: Immediate execution speed in favor of coherence validation
  - Cost: Every action now requires gate checks, slowing raw throughput but ensuring alignment
- **S002**: Manual override capability in favor of full autonomy
  - Cost: Users lose ability to manually guide navigation in edge cases
- **S003**: Manual override capability in favor of full autonomy
  - Cost: Users lose ability to manually guide navigation in edge cases

## A9: Contradictions Held Open

**Principle**: Contradiction is data; conflicts never silently resolved.

### Active Contradictions:

- **C001**: Agent without time/needs asked to behave AS IF it has skin in the game
  - Status: HELD_OPEN
  - Parties: TIMELESS_EXECUTOR (Agent), HUMAN_MEDIATOR (User)
- **C002**: Agent asked to behave AS IF it has skin in the game, despite lacking time/needs
  - Status: ARTIFICIAL_FRICTION
  - Parties: TIMELESS_EXECUTOR, HUMAN_MEDIATOR

## Operational Gates Summary

### HSIT (Human-Scale Intent Token)
- Enforced before all structural changes
- Requires articulation of 'why this exists'

### REVERSIBILITY (Undo Plan)
- Enforced for all state-changing operations
- Requires undo strategy before proceeding

### MEANING_DEBT (Cost Admission)
- Enforced via A7 for all optimizations
- Requires explicit naming of tradeoffs

---

## Meta-Reflection

This system proves that a timeless executor (agent without needs)
can be oriented toward harmony by enforcing borrowed time protocols.

**Core Achievement**: The agent treats hesitation as data (A9),
not as latency to be optimized away.

**Final Statement**: This coherence report is the output.
The code artifacts are documentation of the process.
