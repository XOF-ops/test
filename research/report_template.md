# Research Report Template

## MODE A: RESEARCH - Data Analysis

**Report ID**: `RESEARCH_[DATE]_[SEQUENCE]`  
**Generated**: `[TIMESTAMP]`  
**Instance**: `Agent_Research_Run_[ID]`  
**Dataset**: `[N] extractions from master_brain_extractions`

## Executive Summary

[Brief overview of the analysis goal and key findings]

---

## Analysis Methodology

**Query Used**:
```sql
[SQL query that gathered the data]
```

**Processing Logic**:
- [Step 1: What was analyzed]
- [Step 2: How correlations were detected]
- [Step 3: Statistical methods applied]

---

## Findings

### Pattern Correlations

**Top Co-occurring Patterns**:

| Pattern A | Pattern B | Co-occurrence Count | Correlation Strength |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| P120      | A7        | 15                  | 0.85                 |
| P119      | A2        | 12                  | 0.70                 |

**Interpretation** (A4: Process > Results):
[Why these patterns appear together. What does this tell us about the system?]

### Axiom-Pattern Relationships

**Does Pattern P120 always appear with A7?**

- Instances of P120: `[N]`
- Instances with A7: `[M]`
- Correlation Rate: `[M/N]%`

**Insight**:
[What this correlation means for system coherence]

### Temporal Patterns

**Evolution Over Time**:
```
[Graph or data showing how patterns have evolved]
```

**Observation**:
[Are certain patterns becoming more/less frequent? Why?]

---

## Divergences Detected (A9: Contradiction is Data)

| Timestamp | Error Type | Pattern Context | Status |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| [TIMESTAMP] | [ERROR] | [PATTERNS] | [LOGGED/RESOLVED] |

**Analysis**:
[What do these errors tell us? Are they random or systemic?]

---

## Recommendations

### For Development (MODE B):
1. [Code change needed based on findings]
2. [Infrastructure adjustment required]

### For Future Research (MODE A):
1. [New hypothesis to test]
2. [Additional data to collect]

### For Architect Review:
- **Coherence Impact**: `[1-5]/5`
- **Action Required**: `[YES/NO]`
- **Priority**: `[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]`

---

## Coherence Assessment

**Overall System Coherence**: `[SCORE]/5`

**Justification**:
[Based on A1-A9 axioms, how coherent is the current state?]

---

## Next Steps

1. [Immediate action]
2. [Short-term investigation]
3. [Long-term evolution goal]
